Emotion detection technology, particularly through facial expression recognition, is transforming how we interact with computers by enabling systems to understand and respond to human emotions. This project focuses on developing a real-time emotion detection system using advanced tools like the FER library for recognizing emotions and MTCNN for accurate facial landmark detection. The system processes live video feeds, analyzing facial expressions to identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more. By offering immediate feedback based on these emotions, the project demonstrates how emotion-aware systems can enhance user experience and interaction in various applications.
